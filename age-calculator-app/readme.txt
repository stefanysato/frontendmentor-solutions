I started by building the structure in HTML, as usual, and proceeded to styling the page according to the designs provided by Frontend Mentor, using a mobile-first approach in order to make it responsive.

Moving on to the JS, I declared the variables to the HTML elements I wanted to manipulate and created the main function to calculate the age, which was easy to make and the app was already working at this point, but I still had to validate the input values.

At first I tried to validate all the fields in one function, but I wasn't getting the results I wanted, so I realised it would be better if I created one function for each, this way if there was just one incorrect value, it wouldn't affect the others.
There are probably better solutions to this one, because I feel I used too many variables, especially to add the "error" classes.

I watched a 
[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=515iC2CL__8&t=1455s) on YouTube to help me finish it, because I got stuck on a few functionalities, so I didn't build it all by myself (but mostly!). Still, it helped me understand, so it was valid.
